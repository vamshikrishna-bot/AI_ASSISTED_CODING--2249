        "*   Sorting by multiple keys (e.g., `(user['age'], user['name'])`) is also straightforward and readable, as Python's `sorted()` function handles tuples for multi-level sorting naturally.\n",

        "*   **Space Complexity:** The `sorted()` function creates a new sorted list, so its space complexity is O(n).\n",
        "*   **Stability:** Timsort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means that if two elements have the same key, their relative order in the original list is preserved in the sorted list. This is particularly useful when sorting by multiple keys (as demonstrated in the 'Sorted by age, then name' example, where users with the same age maintain their original order based on their name implicitly unless explicitly sorted by name).\n",

        "### Explanation of the `is_armstrong` function\n",
        "\n",
        "The `is_armstrong` function is designed to check if a given integer is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a special type of number where the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the total number of digits, equals the original number itself. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because it has 3 digits, and 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the function's logic:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Convert to String and Count Digits:**\n",
        "    The first step inside the function is to convert the input `number` into a string (`num_str`). This conversion is crucial because it allows us to easily determine two key pieces of information:\n",
        "    *   The total number of digits in the number (`num_digits`) by taking the length of the string (`len(num_str)`).\n",
        "    *   Individual digits can be easily accessed by iterating through the characters of the string.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Calculate Sum of Powers:**\n",
        "    A variable `sum_of_powers` is initialized to `0`. The code then enters a `for` loop that iterates through each character (`digit_char`) in the `num_str`.\n",
        "    *   Inside the loop, each `digit_char` (which is a string) is converted back into an integer (`digit = int(digit_char)`).\n",
        "    *   This `digit` is then raised to the power of `num_digits` (the total count of digits in the original number) using the exponentiation operator (`**`).\n",
        "    *   The result of this exponentiation is added to `sum_of_powers`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Comparison and Return Value:**\n",
        "    After the loop completes, `sum_of_powers` holds the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits. The function then compares this `sum_of_powers` with the original `number`.\n",
        "    *   If `sum_of_powers` is equal to `number`, it means the number fits the definition of an Armstrong number, and the function returns `True`.\n",
        "    *   Otherwise, if they are not equal, the function returns `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, an Armstrong number is defined by this process: take a number, count its digits, then sum each digit raised to the power of that count. If the result is the original number, it's an Armstrong number.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Usage:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The code block also includes several `print` statements that demonstrate how to use the `is_armstrong` function:\n",
        "*   `print(f\"Is 153 an Armstrong number? {is_armstrong(153)}\")` checks `153`, which is expected to be `True`.\n",
        "*   `print(f\"Is 9 an Armstrong number? {is_armstrong(9)}\")` checks `9` (a single-digit number is an Armstrong number if it's equal to itself raised to the power of 1), expected `True`.\n",
        "*   `print(f\"Is 371 an Armstrong number? {is_armstrong(371)}\")` checks `371`, expected `True`.\n",
        "*   `print(f\"Is 123 an Armstrong number? {is_armstrong(123)}\")` checks `123`, expected `False`.\n",
        "*   `print(f\"Is 1634 an Armstrong number? {is_armstrong(1634)}\")` checks `1634`, expected `True`.\n",
        "\n",

        "**Original `is_armstrong` Function:**\n",
        "*   **Approach:** Converted the input `number` to a string (`str(number)`). This allowed for easy counting of digits (`len(num_str)`) and iteration through individual digits (`for digit_char in num_str`).\n",

        "*   **Method for Digit Extraction:** Uses the modulo operator (`% 10`) to get the last digit and integer division (`// 10`) to remove the last digit, repeating until the number becomes zero.\n",
        "*   **Method for Digit Count:** A `while` loop with integer division (`// 10`) increments a counter until the number is reduced to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why these changes lead to an improved program (Optimization Benefits):**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Avoidance of Type Conversion Overhead:** The most significant optimization comes from avoiding the conversion of the integer `number` to a string and back to an integer for each digit. Type conversions, especially between numerical types and strings, can be computationally expensive. Python needs to allocate memory for the new string object, populate it with character data, and then for each character, convert it back to an integer. The optimized version performs direct arithmetic operations, which are natively fast at the processor level.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Efficiency of Arithmetic Operations:** Integer division (`//`) and the modulo operator (`%`) are fundamental arithmetic operations that processors handle very efficiently. They are generally much faster than string manipulation functions (like `len()` and string iteration) when dealing with numerical data, especially in a loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Memory Efficiency:** While not a major concern for typical integer sizes, avoiding string conversions also implicitly reduces temporary memory allocations. Each string conversion creates a new string object in memory. For very large numbers or repeated calls, this could lead to less optimal memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Scalability:** For extremely large numbers (though Python's arbitrary-precision integers might mitigate some string-related scaling issues for very large numbers), arithmetic manipulation tends to scale more predictably and efficiently than string-based approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Readability (Maintained):** Despite the technical change, the `is_armstrong_optimized` function maintains a high level of readability. The use of `while` loops with modulo and integer division is a common and understandable pattern for digit manipulation in numerical algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, by switching from string-based processing to purely mathematical operations, the `is_armstrong_optimized` function achieves better efficiency by reducing type conversion overhead and leveraging faster, native arithmetic computations, while retaining its clarity."
